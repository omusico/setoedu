								<h2>Culture and Etiquette</h2>
								<p><b>Tatami Mats</b><br/>
									<figure style="float:left; padding-right:10px;"><img src="images/tatami.jpg"></img></figure>
									Many Japanese homes have rooms with traditional tatami floor covering. Tatami floors are made of tightly woven rice straw called tatami mats. Carpet and rugs are allowed on tatami floors. Shoes should not be worn inside the house, even in rooms with hardwood flooring. It is proper etiquette to wear slippers inside the house except in tatami rooms where slippers should be removed. You can get comfortable by sitting down or lying back on the tatami floor.
								</p>
								<p><b>Futon</b><br/>
								<figure style="float:left; padding-right:10px;"><img src="images/futon.jpg"></img></figure>
									A futon is a traditional Japanese sleeping mattress. It is not a portable bed or convertible sofa found in North America. A futon is laid on the floor at night and rolled up and stored in the closet when not in use. A futon can also be laid on the bed. On sunny days, you can hang the futon outside and use a stick to beat the dust off. Electric futon dryers are available at home appliance stores.

Graduate schools in major universities are highly recognized and many international students choose to study here.

								<h2>Life Utilities</h2>
								<p><b>Electrical appliances</b><br/>
									Power voltage throughout Japan is 100V. The frequency of electric current is 50Hz in Eastern Japan (e.g., Tokyo) and 60Hz in Western Japan (e.g., Osaka). The switch on the circuit breaker, located in your apartment unit or house, should be turned on once you have moved in. You should also contact your local power company to open an account.
								</p>
								<p><b>Gas</b><br/>
									In most apartments, gas is used for the kitchen stove and the water heater. The bathtub has an independent gas water heater used to re-heat the water. Always make sure there is enough water in the bathtub before using the water heater, otherwise this may result in a fire. Each gas appliance (e.g., stove, water heater) requires a specific gas type.

								<h2>Professional Sport</h2>
									<p><b>Sumo</b><br/>
									<figure style="float:left; padding-right:10px;"><img src="images/sumo.jpg"></img></figure>
										Sumo is the national sport of Japan and dates back to the Edo Period (1603 - 1867). The wrestlers will face off in a ring, and a winner is declared when one either steps out of the ring or touches the ground with anything but the soles of his feet. Each match will usually last only a few seconds. Professional sumo wrestlers participate in the "Grand Sumo Tournament".
									</p>
									<p>
										Wrestlers are divided into six different fighting divisions. Wrestlers in the top two of these divisions, "Maku-uchi" and "Jyu-ryo", receive salary. Except for in the top division, "Maku-uchi", each wrestler is ranked by a number indicating where in his division he stands. In the "Maku-uchi" division, the top five rankings are given names and the highest three are called Yokozuna (grand champion wrestler),Ozeki and Sekiwake.
