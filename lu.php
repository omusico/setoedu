									<h2>Life Utilities</h2>
								<p><b>Electrical appliances</b><br/>
									Power voltage throughout Japan is 100V. The frequency of electric current is 50Hz in Eastern Japan (e.g., Tokyo) and 60Hz in Western Japan (e.g., Osaka). The switch on the circuit breaker, located in your apartment unit or house, should be turned on once you have moved in. You should also contact your local power company to open an account.
								</p>
								<p><b>Gas</b><br/>
									In most apartments, gas is used for the kitchen stove and the water heater. The bathtub has an independent gas water heater used to re-heat the water. Always make sure there is enough water in the bathtub before using the water heater, otherwise this may result in a fire. Each gas appliance (e.g., stove, water heater) requires a specific gas type.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are two different types of gas available in Japan. In most cities, underground gas pipe lines provide "City Gas", which is a mixture of liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. In other areas, where gas pipe lines do not reach, compressed gas cylinders containing liquefied propane gas are used.
								</p>
								<p>
									Gas supply valves are located in the kitchen and bathroom. Make sure to turn off all gas valves before going to sleep and when leaving your home. Gas leak detectors must be checked periodically. Once you contact your local gas company to set up an account, a technician will come to service your apartment and inform you of safety instructions.
								</p>
								
								<p><b>Water Supply</b><br/>
									Drinking tap water is very common in Japan. Chlorine concentration in tap water is maintained at a safe level so there is no need to boil it before use. When moving to a new home, be sure to contact your local water supply company to set up an account.
