								<h2 class="start">Message From The Chairperson</h2>
								<p>SETO ACADEMY has been incorporated with the vision of being a leader in language and cultural studies and further studies in foreign countries. To initiate this project and meet our goals, first we have chosen Japanese language and Japan for some outstanding reasons.</p>
								<p>First, we the founders of SETO ACADEMY have had vivid experience of living, studying and working in Japan. We have not only been absorbed with Japanese people and their culture, but also highly impressed with their humility, humbleness, hospitality and hard work. Similarly, we realize that the cultural orientation from the Japanese society has very strong influence on the Nepalese students and migrant workers in Japan and when they get back home in Nepal, they are still found to carry such remarkably positive norms throughout their life and to live happy, humble and successful back home. This really touches us.</p>
								<p>Secondly, we are greatly excited seeing the facilities of learning and training in Japan. Besides Japanese language schools, there are a huge number of higher education institutions: vocational colleges, graduate schools and universities which can be a Mecca for learning. Also, the provision of generous scholarship from the MEXT as well as the respective institutions can be a great privilege to all bright students. Recently, the government’s initiation of Global 30 project, with the beginning of 13 Japanese universities to open for higher education in English will surely benefit all international students, including from Nepal. Not to forget, the job and internship placement during and after the study period can be both financial incentive and skill-learning opportunity for students. As a result, our aspiring abroad study goers will come home with a good foundation for their bright future. We want to see them successful in life.</p>
								<p>Finally, our own experience and expertise in language, research and management encourage us to venture a strongly academic language academy, which is very rare in the region. While most of the language and test preparation courses are taken as informal and merely custom-tailored learning package in Nepal in the lack of proper supervision and regulation, we decided, to be different and most effective, we should have standard course curriculum and licensed instructors. After a long research and incorporation with Japanese team and organization, we finally come up with unique and best learning class packages which are as par any Nihon Gakkuin in Japan. </p>
								<p>We believe we can lead the abroad education market in Japan. Furthermore, our research is going on and very soon, we will be launching other two languages: Korean and Chinese as to add the steps to become the first, successful, private language academy.<br/><br/>
									Sincerely,<br/><br/>
