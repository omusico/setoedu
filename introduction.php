								<h2>Welcome To SETO ACADEMY</h2>
								<p>We are glad that you have chosen to visit us. It is our immense pleasure to welcome you to SETO ACADEMY, a vibrant school that offers education in Japanese language and culture and provides further education consultancy services for studying in Japan.</p>
								<p>SETO Academy was conceived and incorporated as a private education institute registered and approved by the Government of Nepal. It was established by the noble efforts and endeavors of a group of dedicated academic and managerial professionals.</p>
								<p>At SETO ACADEMY, now we offer various academic courses of Japanese language and culture, as coordinated by Native Japanese Language instructors. Our students will explore vast arrays of learning resources including daily audio and visual materials. They not only get exposed to the well-organized and suitably-tailored presentation of native speakers in lecture sessions, but also try to consolidate their learning during tutorials where they will engage in various learning materials like games and interaction. The main aim of our school is to provide quality education as par the Japanese language schools in Japan. </p>
								<p>Similarly, we provide intensive courses of test preparation like JLPT, NAT and EJU, for the students to get enrolled in good colleges and universities in Japan. While these test reports are mandatory for some regions like Tokyo and Osaka as per the requirement of Japan immigration, some good institutions ask them for enrollment as well. For this, our courses will help students prepare for their test confidently and successfully, with the regular mock tests and vigorous practice under the strict invigilation of the instructors. </p>
								<p>Finally, we assist aspirant students to enroll in the college or university of their choice in many different locations in Japan. Students have choices to either study in English language and Japanese while they are in Japan. We assist our students to organize their documents for Certificate of Eligibility and further visa application. There is also a provision for scholarship and grants for eligible and brilliant students who can apply with our professional assistance.  Once they land in Japan, it is also our responsibility that they are studying well and living happily. We visit our partner schools regularly and always keep in touch with our students studying there. </p>
								<p>We believe we can provide you the best possible service for learning Japanese language and further studies in Japan. </p>
