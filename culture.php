									<h2>Culture and Etiquette</h2>
								<p><b>Tatami Mats</b><br/>
									<figure style="float:left; padding-right:10px;"><img src="images/tatami.jpg"></img></figure>
									Many Japanese homes have rooms with traditional tatami floor covering. Tatami floors are made of tightly woven rice straw called tatami mats. Carpet and rugs are allowed on tatami floors. Shoes should not be worn inside the house, even in rooms with hardwood flooring. It is proper etiquette to wear slippers inside the house except in tatami rooms where slippers should be removed. You can get comfortable by sitting down or lying back on the tatami floor.
								</p>
								<p><b>Futon</b><br/>
								<figure style="float:left; padding-right:10px;"><img src="images/futon.jpg"></img></figure>
									A futon is a traditional Japanese sleeping mattress. It is not a portable bed or convertible sofa found in North America. A futon is laid on the floor at night and rolled up and stored in the closet when not in use. A futon can also be laid on the bed. On sunny days, you can hang the futon outside and use a stick to beat the dust off. Electric futon dryers are available at home appliance stores.
								</p></br>
								<p><b>Bath</b><br/>
									The Japanese bathroom consists of a bathtub with a separate washing area. There is usually a shower in the washing area where you are to wash and rinse your body before entering the bathtub. Never wash your body in the bathtub. The hot water in the bathtub is shared with other family members so it must be kept clean. The bathtub has a gas water heater so that you can re-heat the water. The bathtub is strictly for soaking in, much like a spa.
								</p>
								<p><b>Restrooms</b><br/>
									In Japan there is usually a separate room for the toilet. When the toilet is not in use, the door should be kept closed. The door should be locked from the inside when in use, indicating to others that it is occupied. When using a toilet in a private home, you should take your slippers off in exchange for slippers used exclusively for the restroom. Once you flush the toilet, the faucet in the sink placed on top of the water tank will dispense water for you to wash your hands.
								</p>
								<p>
									When using a public restroom, make sure to carry a pack of tissue with you as toilet paper is not always provided. It is also wise to carry a handkerchief or small cloth with you to dry your hands in case paper towels and dryers are not available.
								</p>		
								<p>
									You can still find traditional Japanese squat toilets in some older apartments and public rest rooms.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Moving</b><br/>
								When you move in to a new town, it is uncommon for your neighbors to welcome you. Instead, it is Japanese custom for you to visit your nearest neighbors to introduce yourself.</p>
								<p>Most people never visit each other in complex housing (e.g. apartment buildings), but it is still a good idea to say hello your neighbors.</p>
								<p><b>Neighborhood</b><br/>
									It is very rare for a local community to impose a law to neighborhoods to maintain their lawn and front garden. Neighbors cooperate to clean the roads and parks in their own community. This even includes planting flowers. Some communities have evacuation drills on a routine basis to prepare for fires and big earthquakes.
								</p>
								<p><b>Greetings</b><br/>
									Bowing is the way Japanese people greet each other. Unlike the western greeting of shaking hands or exchanging a hug, it is not part of the Japanese custom to touch others even for those of close relationship. It is important to respect each other's personal space.
								</p>
								<p><b>Table Etiquette</b><br/>
									For Japanese cuisine, it is proper table etiquette to hold your bowl when eating rice or to sip directly from a bowl of "miso soup". It is acceptable to make slurping noises while eating Japanese noodles like "soba" and "udon". It is also acceptable to bite off food that is too big to fit in your mouth, and it is considered polite to finish your entire meal.
									Most people in Japan enjoy the cuisine from other countries in their daily meals. Since table manners vary from country to country, always dine using the appropriate etiquette. For example, it would be considered rude to slurp on long pasta noodles, biting off a whole steak or drinking directly from a bowl clam chowder.
								</p>		

								<p><b>Gratuity</b></br>
									Tipping is not customary in Japan. Tips are not even necessary for taxi, room service at the hotel, restaurant and pizza delivery.<br/>
